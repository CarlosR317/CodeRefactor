# CodeRefactor:In this project I made sure the website will remain accessible by adding "meta" tags and ensuring that it can fit all devices. Website was also given name. All links to css, img, and websites were checked and ensured for functionality. All appropriate img were given alt tags. "div" were changed appropriately to better organize the code; semantic HTML elements were used. Code formatting was used. CSS page was updated correctly.
